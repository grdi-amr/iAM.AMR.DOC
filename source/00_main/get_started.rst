Getting Started
===============
Welcome to the iAM.AMR project!

The first step in getting started is to explore this documentation; get to know the project in-depth here!

Then, check out our `Start-Here GitHub repository <https://goto.iam.amr.pub/repo-start-here>`_. GitHub is where we host our models, store more of our documentation, and do our model development.

Finally, fetch and run the models!

For the Public
--------------
At present, the models are not being openly circulated. Please contact |pm| to be granted access to the model repositories.


For New Collaborators
---------------------
The first step is to complete the `on-boarding survey <https://goto.iam.amr.pub/onboarding>`_. Then, access the `iAM.AMR GitHub Organization <https://goto.iam.amr.pub/github>`_ (requires approval, and login). If you can't access these links, contact |pm|. Note, it may take up to 48h after completing the onboarding survey to be added -- before you reach out, ensure you've accepted all invites at `our GitHub Organization's invite page <https://github.com/orgs/iAM-AMR/invitation>`_ and checked the *Notifications* section.

See our `Start Here repository <https://goto.iam.amr.pub/gh-start-here-github>`_ for  more information.
