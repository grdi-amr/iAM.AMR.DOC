Extracting a Factor
-------------------

Defining the factor itself
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Which factors are considered relevant points of comparison, and which are not?**

Factors listed here are considered "unmodifiable" or "immutable", and thus not relevant for our purposes:

- :ref:`Immutable Factors <data_extraction/data_extract_rules:Immutable Factors>`

For examples of extractable factors, please see:

- :ref:`Common Factor Types <data_extraction/form_factor:Common factor types>`


Selecting exposed and referent groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Groups are otherwise referred to as levels.

**Which is which?**

:ref:`Selecting a Referent Level <data_extraction/data_extract_rules:Selecting a Referent Level>`

**What should I do when a group is not clearly defined (i.e. an "Other" group)?**

:ref:`Non-informative Levels <data_extraction/data_extract_rules:Non-informative Levels>`

**What should I do when there are more than two designated groups in the study?**

:ref:`Multiple Discrete Levels (Categories) <data_extraction/data_extract_rules:Multiple Discrete Levels (Categories)>`

:ref:`Non-informative Levels <data_extraction/data_extract_rules:Non-informative Levels>`
