Beta
----
Prevalence, in the context of epidemiology, is the proportion of a population expressing a characteristic of interest. A deterministic estimate of prevalence can be calculated as k/n, where k is the number of ‘positive’ units, and ‘n’ represents the total number of units assayed.

Alternatively, we can express our estimate of prevalence probabilistically, using a Beta distribution. In this context, we think of each assay as a Bernoulli trial (or as a series of binomial trials).
