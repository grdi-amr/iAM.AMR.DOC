Data Extraction
===============

Overview
--------
This section provides instructions for data extraction into CEDAR. If you are not familiar with CEDAR, please see the :ref:`entry on CEDAR <02_project/CEDAR:The CEDAR Database>`.

There are two types of data you will be extracting: reference-level data, which provides context for the outcome, and factor-level data, which describes the outcome itself. These data are entered in a reference-level form, and a factor-level form respectively.

On the *Add or Edit a Reference* form, you will extract reference-level information such as:

- study location
- study design
- reporting methods

On the *Add or Edit a Factor* form, you will extract factor-level information such as:

- the exposed and referent groups
- the host, microbe, and resistance tested
- counts, rates, or odds ratios describing the effect of the factor

Geographic versions of CEDAR_forest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To simplify data extraction, two versions of the CEDAR back-end *CEDAR_forest* were created: *CEDAR_forest_east* for access from the GoC network, and *CEDAR_forest_west* for access from outside the GoC network.
