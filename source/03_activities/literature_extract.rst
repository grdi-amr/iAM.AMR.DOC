Data Extraction
===============

Overview
--------
This section provides instructions for data extraction into CEDAR. If you are not familiar with CEDAR, please review the :ref:`section on CEDAR <02_project/CEDAR:The CEDAR Database>`.

There are two types of data you will be extracting: reference-level data, which provides context for the outcome, and factor-level data, which describes the outcome itself. These data are entered in a reference-level form, and a factor-level form respectively.

On the *Add or Edit a Reference* form, you will extract reference-level information such as:

- study location
- study design
- reporting methods

On the *Add or Edit a Factor* form, you will extract factor-level information such as:

- the exposed and referent groups
- the host, microbe, and resistance tested
- counts, rates, or odds ratios describing the effect of the factor

Geographic versions of CEDAR_forest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To simplify data extraction, two versions of the CEDAR back-end *CEDAR_forest* were created: *CEDAR_forest_east* for access from the GoC network, and *CEDAR_forest_west* for access from outside the GoC network.


Common Concerns
---------------

What do I do if ...

... there are no factors to extract
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If there are no factors to extract, indicate this using the notes field, and skip the reference.

... the data are only available in a figure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If factor data are only available in a figure (i.e. no numbers are given on a graph, or in text), and the numerical value cannot be determined with certainty (i.e. is not zero or 100%), indicate this using the notes field, and skip extracting the factor.

... the data are presented only as a relative risk?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We cannot use relative risk at this time. Do not extract the factor's data, but indicate the omission in the notes field.

... I'm confused about how to extract a factor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you're confused about a factor, reach out on Slack for clarification. Additionally, add a note to indicate why the factor was extracted in that way.

... an item I need is missing from a dropdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If an item is missing from a dropdown (i.e. a non-free-text field), reach out on Slack. If the decision is made to use an alternative item in the list, add a note to justify this replacement. 

... the results are in log(Odds) or an estimate/coefficient of a logistic regression?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Recall that the Odds Ratio = e^x, where x is the coefficient.

... there are multiple measurements of the same factor?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See below.

... the study uses SIR (Susceptible, Intermediate, and Resistant)?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a study includes an 'Intermediate' category, add the intermediate isolates/rate to the resistant category (i.e. we round up intermediate to resistant).

... I want to compare conventional, ABF, organic, 'welfare' or 'humane' production systems?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that these alternative systems are not the same. While all organic is ABF (antibiotic-free), not all ABF is organic. 'Welfare' and 'humane' production systems are likewise different. 


Add or Edit a Reference
-----------------------

Basic info
~~~~~~~~~~
The basic information section should already be completed, and you will not have to extract this information.

Study info
~~~~~~~~~~

Study identifiers
+++++++++++++++++
Extract the DOI (preferred), or PMID (if available). However, this section should already be completed if available.

Study design
++++++++++++
Select a study design from the dropdown menu. Then, extract additional detail from the text. The detail should include information such as:

- unit selection process
- experimental group allocation
- experimental conditions

Then, extract the sampling method from the text. This can be as simple as the sample type (e.g. "fecal samples collected from fresh pats on the barn floor"), or may include additional information (e.g. "Two clinical swabs per steer were inserted approximately 5 cm into the rectum and rotated until covered with a uniform amount of feces.") if available.

Study reporting
+++++++++++++++
Indicate whether or not the study included explicit AST breakpoints, and an MIC table. A study includes explicit breakpoints where each antimicrobial assayed includes a corresponding numerical break point in text (e.g. 8 mg/ml). An example of an MIC table is provided below:

.. figure:: /assets/figures/example_MIC_table.png
   :align: center

   An example of an MIC table from Avrain et al. (2003).


Location
~~~~~~~~
Select the country where the study was conducted. If more detail is provided than at country-level, include all sub-regions in the field below. Where multiple sub-regions are provided, record each. Where no specific sub-regions are provided, select "other" from the sub-region dropdown, and provide addtional detail. 

For example, if a study was conducted in Ohio and Michigan of the United States of America, select "United States of America" as the location, and include two sub-regions, "Ohio" and "Michigan". If the study was described as being conducted "in the mid-west USA", select "United States of America" as the location, and include a sub-region "other", with details "mid-west".

Auditing
~~~~~~~~
This section is managed by a CEDAR administrator. You do not need to add or edit values here, unless explicitly directed to do so.

Notes and issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This section allows you to attach notes describing problems with extraction, additional context, or omitted factors.

Attach a seperate note for each concern.



Add or Edit a Factor
--------------------

Title
~~~~~
Create a title to describe the factor in title case. 

The title should be simple, direct, and give no experimental context -- the title should be generic, as to easily identify comparable factors between studies. There are two specific cases recognized: 

- where the factor solely describes antimicrobial use, the title should be recorded in the format "<Antimicrobial> Use", where <Antimicrobial> is the antimicrobial used

- where the factor describes production type (i.e. a comparison between conventional, and organic, ABF, or free-range production), the title should be recorded as "Production Type"

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Create a description to provide context in sentence case.

The description should include relevant experimental conditions, not captured elsewhere in data extraction. This includes details such as the identity and quantity of antimicrobials administered, duration of exposure, prior antimicrobial use, etc.. 

For example, the factor titled "Chlortetracyline Use" may have a description: "Chlortetracyline, administered in feed (days 17 - 78, 164 - 206), as Aureomycin 100-g at 11 ppm. Isolates cultured on agar amended with 4 Î¼g/ml TET-HCL."

Note that this is a particularly data-rich example -- many factors will not be recorded with that level of detail because it is not reported in the literature.

Host and microbe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Select a host and microbe from the dropdown menus. Once you select a host, you will be able to select a host sub-type. Likewise, once you select a microbe, you will be able to select a microbe sub-type. 

.. attention:: The sub-type will only be shown correctly if the type used in the last record selected is a parent of the sub-type. For example -- for a reference with two factors -- if the first factor was for cattle, and the second factor for chicken: while the cattle factor is in focus (selected), the cattle sub-type will be shown, but the chicken sub-type will disappear (and vice-versa). This also applies to the microbe and microbe sub-type dropdown, and similarly applies to the AMU field.

Do not be alarmed if the sub-types seem to disappear when extracting from a paper with multiple host or microbe types -- the data are still there, but not visable. You can check the data are still there by selecting the record (by interacting with one of the fields, or clicking in the white-space around the fields).

Location
~~~~~~~~
Location (Loc.) refers to the location of the factors' data in the text. This is generally a table or figure. However, if the data are in the body of the text, use page (pg.) and paragraph (para.) numbers to indicate the location. Always use the physical page number if available.  If only the electronic page number is available (the page in the PDF), use the electronic page number (epg.).

Result
~~~~~~
Result refers to the format of the factors' data. Data are presented in one of several formats: 

- as contingency tables (counts of AMR+, AMR-, and totals)
- as rate tables (percentages of AMR+, AMR -, and totals)
- as relative risks
- as odds ratios

When multiple data formats are available, we always prefer **contingency tables** (count data), followed by rate tables, and finally odds ratios or relative risk. You only need to extract one format of data for a given factor.

Stage
~~~~~
Select both an allocation and observtion production stage:

- The *allocation stage* refers to the production stage at which the exposed and referent groups are effectively established, and where the factor effectuates change.

- The *observation stage* refers to the production stage at which the effects of the factor are observed, and where sampling was performed.

.. tip:: A study which involves the retail sampling of organically- and conventionally-raised chicken products to determine the effect of production type would have an allocation stage of *Farm*, and a observation stage of *Retail*, as the factor effectuates changes on-farm, but these are measured at retail.

AMR
~~~
Select the ingredient to which resistance was assayed. As you begin to type, the field will be auto-completed from the list of available ingredients. If you cannot locate the appropriate ingredient, try :ref:`exploring the available ingredients <03_activities/literature_extract:Selecting an Antimicrobial>`.

Exposed and referent groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Describe both the exposed and referent groups, in title case.

The exposed and referent groups are allocated as described in the literature (i.e. if the authors use 'wood curl bedding' as the exposure, and 'flax bedding' as the referent, it should be recorded as such). 

If no allocation is provided, the interventionist practice should be used as the exposure, and the default practice should be used as the referent (i.e. 'doing something' is the exposure, 'doing nothing' is the referent). 

The exception to these rules is *Antimicrobial Use*. Where the factor describes antimicrobial use -- regardless of how the authors allocate the exposed and referent groups -- the exposure should always be antimicrobial use, and the referent should always be no use. Additionally, the factor should be recorded in the format "<Antimicrobial> Use" (where <Antimicrobial> is the antimicrobial used), and "No Use".

For example, if a study compares the rates of resistance in broilers administered ceftiofur, the exposure should be recorded as "Ceftiofur Use" and the referent as "No Use".

Result or analysis unit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Select the unit of analysis (i.e. the unit allocated to the exposed and referent groups). Generally, this will be at the isolate or sample level, but some analyses are conducted at the flock, herd or farm levels.

AMU
~~~
Select the ingredients used as part of the factor. As you begin to type, the field will be auto-completed from the list of available ingredients. Then, select 'Add AMU' to add the ingredient to the list. Likewise, highlight the ingredient and select 'Delete AMU' to remove it from the list.

Refer to the :ref:`selecting an antimicrobial <03_activities/literature_extract:Selecting an Antimicrobial>` section for details on how to extract data for factors including multiple ingredients.


Selecting an Antimicrobial
--------------------------
We use the WHO's ATCvet index as our controlled vocabulary for recording antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and antimicrobial use (AMU).

The process of selecting an antimicrobial to describe AMR (i.e. the resistance assayed) is straightforward, owing to the fact only one antimicrobial is assayed at a given time, and there are a limited number of antimicrobials included in most antimicrobial susceptibility tests (ASTs).

The process of selecting antimicrobial(s) to describe AMU is more complex, as multiple antimicrobials may be used at a given time, and in a greater number of combinations.

Regardless of whether you are selecting an antimicrobial for AMR or AMU, the goal is the same -- to find the most appropriate and specific ATCvet code that describes the antimicrobial(s).

.. note:: You do not need to have direct knowledge of, or work with the ATCvet codes directly. When we say *'select an ATCvet code'*, what we really mean is *'select the most appropriate ingredient(s), represented in the ATCvet index'*.

Below, we use the terms *ingredient*, *antiinfective* and *antimicrobial*, and these are largely interchangable for our purposes. An *ingredient* is a generic term for an item described in the index. An *antiinfective* is an umbrella term for an ingredient with anti-infective properties (e.g. an antimicrobial, antiparasitic, or a compound like copper sulphate that has antimicrobial properties). And an *antimicrobial* is an ingredient with antimicrobial properties, generally recognized as a 'drug'. 

An AST generally includes at least one traditional *antiinfective*, and may include one or more additional *active ingredients* (e.g. chlortetracycline and copper supplementation) or an adjuvant (e.g. penicillin with a beta-lactamase inhibitor).

ATCVet Code Reference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can explore the ATCVet codes using the **Search ATCvet by AM** form. 

This form allows you to enter a single ingredient, and view all codes where that ingredient is included. Additionally, it will show you the class (level 4 grouping) to which the ingredient belongs, other ingredients in that class, and any combinations in which it may be involved outside of the class (level 3 grouping).

.. tip:: You can view the entire ATCvet index by opening the table *s_atc_vet* in the *Navigation Pane*.

Selecting an ATCvet Code with one ingredient
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Select the appropriate ingredient. 


Two ingredients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An antiinfective and adjuvant
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Select the appropriate combination of ingredients. Generally, the adjuvant is not explicitly listed, but is specified by class. 

e.g. *amoxicillin and clavulanic acid* would be recorded as *amoxicillin and beta-lactamase inhibitor*.

An antiinfective and active ingredient
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
If the ingredients include an antiinfective and another active ingredient...

... and the antiinfective and active ingredient are **explicitly specified** as a combination:
  - select the appropriate combination

    - e.g. *cefepime and amikacin*

... and the antiinfective and active ingredient are **not explicitly specified** as a combination, but **belong to the same class**, or level 4 grouping ...
 ... and a non-specific **class combination exists** ...
  - select the appropriate non-specific combination

    - e.g. oxytetracycline and tigecycline used together would be recorded as *chlortetracycline, combinations*

 ... and a non-specific **class combination does not exist** ...
  - select the appropriate non-specific combination from the *Combinations of Antibacterials* level 3 grouping as described below
  
    - note that this is an uncommon outcome, as most classes include non-specific combinations

... and the antiinfective and active ingredient are **not explicitly specified** as a combination, and **do not belong to the same class**, or level 4 grouping ...
 ... and **one** of the ingredients is included in the *Combinations of Antibacterials* level 3 grouping ...
  - select the appropriate combination
  - additionally, select the individual ingredients

    - e.g. chlortetracycline and sulfamethazine used together would be recorded as *tetracyclines, combinations with other antibacterials*, *chlortetracycline*, and *sulfadimidine*

 ... and **more than one** of the ingredients is included in the *Combinations of Antibacterials* level 3 grouping ...
  - select the appropriate combination using the order of preference below
  - additionally, select the individual ingredients

    1. quinolones 
    2. cephalosporins 
    3. macrolides 
    4. polymyxines 
    5. penicillins 
    6. aminoglycosides 
    7. tetracyclines 
    8. amphenicols 
    9. lincosamides 
    10. sulfonamides

    - e.g. ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin used together would be recorded as *quinolones, combinations with other antibacterials* (not *penicillins, combinations with other antibacterials*), *ciprofloxacin*, and *amoxicillin*
    - e.g. amoxicillin and chlortetracycline used together would be recorded as *penicillins, combinations with other antibacterials* (not *tetracyclines, combinations with other antibacterials*), *amoxicillin*, and *chlortetracycline*


Idiosyncracies of the ATCvet index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Common alternative ingredient names
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The following ingredients have commonly used alternative names -- only the official name is given by ATCvet:

==============  =======================
Common Name     ATCvet Name
==============  =======================
Cephalothin     cefalotin
Cephradine      cefradine
Flavomycin      bambermycin
Penicillin G    benzylpenicillin
Penicillin V/K  phenoxymethylpenicillin
Sulfamethazine  sulfadimidine
Sulfisoxazole   sulfafurazole
==============  ======================= 

Order of ingredients
++++++++++++++++++++

Combinations with sulfonamides are almost always specified with the sulfonamide first
  
  - e.g. *sulfadimidine and trimethoprim*




Data Extraction Rules
---------------------

Immutable Factors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Immutable factors are defined as those that are not practically modifiable or reproducible. These include factors such as:

- unique comparison groups or locations

  - Barn A *vs.* Barn B
  - Sweden *vs.* Switzerland

- breed or type of animal

  - Ross chicks *vs.* Cobb chicks
  - Swedish Friesian vs. Swiss Holsteins

- life stage or production stage  

  - egg *vs.* chick *vs.* broiler
  - grow-finish *vs.* farrow-to-finish
  - farm *vs.* abattoir *vs.* retail

Immutable factors should not be extracted.

Binary and Continuous Factors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a factor is binary (i.e. two discrete outcomes, such as "Yes" and "No"), it shall be extracted. 

When a factor is continuous (e.g. a one unit increase in the predictor results in an X unit increase in the outcome) it shall not be extracted.  

Selecting a Referent Level
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Binary factors consist of a referent and exposure group (e.g. your control and exposure groups respectively). The referent should generally be defined as the default practice in industry, or the least interventionist, while the exposure is the less common, or more interventionist approach. See above for more details. 

Multiple Discrete Levels (Catagories)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When a factor has multiple levels (e.g. low, medium, and high), the factor shall be extracted seperately for each level, using the same referent level.  

For example, for a factor with levels low, medium, and high, the factor is extracted as low *vs.* medium, and low *vs.* high. The factor medium *vs.* high shall not eb extracted. The choice of referent level is described above.

Non-informative Levels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An exception is non-informative levels, which shall not be extracted.

For example, for a factor with levels 'red', 'blue', and 'other', the factor is only extracted as red *vs.* blue, because the 'other' is not part of a defined set, and cannot be inferred from the comparison. But, where levels are drawn from a defined set, they shall be extracted (these are few and far-between). For example, for a factor with levels 'summer', 'winter', 'other', the factor is extracted as 'summer' *vs.* 'winter' and 'summer' *vs.* 'other', as the 'other' can be inferred.


Factor Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

When multiple data formats are available, we always prefer **contingency tables** (count data), followed by rate tables, and finally odds ratios or relative risk. You only need to extract one format of data for a given factor.


Resistances and MDR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All factors related to antimicrobial resistance should be extracted, including those related to non-traditional antimicrobials (e.g. ionophores, coccidiostats, and metals). They should be extracted as finely as possible where specified (e.g. ceftiofur-resistance, rather than third-generation cephalosporin resistance).

Multi-drug resistance (MDR) should not be extracted, because the specific combination of resistances is impossible to compare to across studies/situations. However, if you are presented with MDR data, it may be possible to tease out antimicrobial-specific data. Before you do - ensure that the individual antimicrobial data For example, imagine that 'X' and 'Y' number of isolates were tested for each 'Poor' and 'Good' producers, as in the study below:

.. figure:: /assets/figures/mdr_example.png
   :align: center

   An example of an MDR table using rates from Spears (1990).

We can tease out this information by adding up the occurence of resistance across all profiles, to calculate the number of resistant organisms.

+---------------+------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| Antimicrobial | AMR+ in Poor Producers                               | AMR+ in Good Producers                               |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| GM            | (0.19)(X) +   (0.579)(X) + (0.744)(X)                | (0.218)(Y) +   (0.902)(Y) + (0.451)(Y)               |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| SU            | (0.19)(X) +   (0.579)(X) + (0.1074)(X) + (0.0992)(X) | (0.218)(Y) +   (0.902)(Y) + (0.827)(Y) + (0.0977)(Y) |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| AM            | (0.0165)(X)                                          | (0.0376)(Y)                                          |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+


Multiple Measurements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Often, factors may be assessed at multiple time-points. For example, swine may be sampled for resistant organisms at birth, weaning, growing-finishing, and again at abattoir.  

As a general rule, where the *allocation* and *observation stages* are the same, the **Measurement Closest to Human Exposure** or **MCHE** should be extracted.  

Where the *allocation* and *observation stages* differ, the **MCHE** within the *allocation* stage should be extracted (if available). These rules, and their exceptions, are described below.  

Multiple Measurements at a Single Stage
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Where multiple measurements are available at a single production stage (i.e. the *allocation* and *observation stages* are the same), the measurement closest to human exposure should be extracted, except

... where there are missing or unavailable data at the time-point closest to human exposure

.. admonition:: Example

   Resistance was assayed at days 10, 20, and 30 of production for the exposed group, but only at days 10 and 20 for the referent group.  
   
   Day 20 is extracted.

- where the time-point is not applicable to the Canadian context

  e.g. a measurement at >36 days into broiler production, past the point of harvest in Canadian industry.

Multiple Measurements at Farm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Where multiple measurements are available at the **on-farm stage** for **cattle** and **swine**, a measurement should be extracted at the end of each production sub-stage. This includes the following:

- Cattle

  - Stage 1
  - Stage 2

- Swine
  
  - Stage 1
  - Stage 2

See the production basics section for more information.

Multiple Measurements at Multiple Stages





Provisional Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


3.	Genomic data â record if AMR prevalence given + note what gene in description (can leave AMR dropdown empty â tetA and tetB are available in AMR dropdown though!), otherwise make a note (eg, CFU/g, gene copies, etc.). 

5.	Salmonella species â combine if AMR prevalence given for more than one Salmonella species
